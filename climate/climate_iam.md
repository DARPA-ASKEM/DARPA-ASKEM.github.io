# Climate IAM Pipeline

<mark>TBD, highly notional</mark>: Beaker, Funman, PyCIEMSS, for working with IAM models for forecasting, implementing and comparing interventions, calibration, optimization, etc.

## Overview
<mark>TBD, highly notional</mark>
#### *Target Users*: The Climate IAM Toolkit is targeted towards modelers who work in the climate application space, and are interested in understanding the intersection between climate, economy, and other societal impact areas. 

#### *Features Supported*: Users can use this toolkit to:
*	Start with an IAM model already written in the Mimi Framework,
*	Configure model with new parameter values,
*	Simulate model to create forecasts,
*	Do structural model modifications, including coupling multiple IAMs together,
*	Find an appropriate new set of parameter configurations for the updated models, using Funman satisfiability checks,
*	Run optimization and calibration simulations,
*	Do sensitivity analyses
