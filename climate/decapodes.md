# Decapodes

Coming soon.

## Overview
Coming soon

#### *Target Users*: 
Decapodes can be used by modelers or researchers focused on physical climate models, and who are interested in developing and testing hypotheses to better understand fundamental mechanisms of the climate system through multiphysics modeling. This includes the ability to do rapid model composition with physics equations, apply various boundary conditions, and apply models to complex geographic/geometric meshes, etc. 

#### *Features Supported*: 
Users can use Decapodes to:
*	Start from a pre-populated library of canonical physics, chemistry, biology, and environmental models in exterior calculus form, and a library of commonly used boundary conditions,
*	Do multiphysics model composition 
*	Apply different boundary conditions,
*	Do multiphysics model simulations with complex and arbitrary geographic or geometric meshes
