# Transforming Data

If a dataset doesn't align with their modeling goals, users can transform it by cleaning and modifying it or combining it with other datasets. Doing data transformations in Terarium helps make modeling processes more transparent and reproducible.

In an interactive code notebook, users can describe in plain language the changes they want to make, and a large language model (LLM)-powered assistant automatically generates the code for them.
