# ASKEM

ASKEM aims to create a knowledge-modeling-simulation ecosystem, empowered with the AI approaches and tools needed for the agile creation, sustainment, and enhancement of the complex models and simulators necessary to support expert knowledge- and data-informed decision making in diverse missions and scientific domains. The goal is to enable experts to maintain, reuse, and adapt large collections of heterogeneous data, knowledge, and models â€“ with traceability across knowledge sources, model assumptions, and model fitness.
