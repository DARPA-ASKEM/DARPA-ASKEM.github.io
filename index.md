# DARPA ASKEM Program

DARPA's Automating Scientific Knowledge Extraction and Modeling (ASKEM) program aims to create a knowledge-modeling-simulation ecosystem, empowered with the AI approaches and tools needed for the agile creation, sustainment, and enhancement of the complex models and simulators necessary to support expert knowledge- and data-informed decision making in diverse missions and scientific domains. The goal is to enable experts to maintain, reuse, and adapt large collections of heterogeneous data, knowledge, and models â€“ with traceability across knowledge sources, model assumptions, and model fitness. 

If successful, ASKEM will enable a dramatic acceleration in scientific and engineering advances, improve scientific collaboration, and lead to timelier and more reliable expert guidance to support threat detection, interventions, and decision-making, especially in rapidly evolving environments and mission-critical domains.
