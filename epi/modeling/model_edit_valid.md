# Model Editing and Validation Workflows

Coming soon. (Model --> Mira --> Funman)

## Overview

#### *Target Users*: 
The modeling editing and validation workflow is meant for modelers or researchers who want to transform or extend an existing model in various ways, do model checks to ensure the changes were sensible, and finally, figure out valid model configurations for their new updated model. 

For example, a modeler at a county health department begins with an existing model previously applied nationally, and wants to adapt it for their locality, in order to ask various policy-relevant questions. They want to ensure that the way they have adapted the model is sensible. Now that they have an updated model, they also need to find an updated set of parameter values to apply to it, that are relevant for their locality.

#### *Features Supported*: 
Users may want to use this workflow to:
* Leverage an existing model or bring in a model from a paper, 
* Make structural model modifications, 
* Find an appropriate set of parameter configurations for updated models they create through structural modifications,
* Check that their models obey some core common-sense rules, using Funman satisfiability checks
