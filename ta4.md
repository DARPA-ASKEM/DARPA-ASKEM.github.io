# Integrated HMI System: Terarium Workbench

Coming soon.
## Overview

#### *Target Users*: 
The Terarium workbench can be used by modelers who want to utilize all the technology available in ASKEM to work with ODE models in a largely low-code environment, with options to access more complex functionality through a notebook interface on a case-by-case basis. The end user does not need to be an expert modeler, and may want to rapidly create and iterate on exploratory workflows with models and simulations, and leverage work done by other Terarium users.

#### *Features Supported*: 
Users can use Terarium to:
* Leverage an existing model in the workbench database, or bring in a model from a paper, 
* Bring in multiple models and compare their biases, limitations, strengths, and how they are used

Users can do model extension/edits and validation:
*	Structural model comparison for model selection purposes
*	Extend existing domain knowledge graphs (DKGs) or add new DKGs, for new contexts
*	Structural model modifications
*	Find an appropriate new set of parameter configurations for updated models they create through structural modifications
*	Check that their models obey some core common-sense rules, using Funman satisfiability checks

User can do simulation workflows:
*	Deterministic and probabilistic calibration 
*	Deterministic and probabilistic simulation (including forecasts)
*	Implement interventions
*	Counterfactual analysis and estimation of causal impacts of interventions
*	Risk based optimization of intervention policies, under uncertainty
*	Generate ensemble forecasts
